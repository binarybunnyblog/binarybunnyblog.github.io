      <description>It was midnight of four days ago (or five? I don&amp;rsquo;t remember exactly how many) when someone texts me a job offer. I accepted it, of course. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a software developer. That&amp;rsquo;s my first job and I&amp;rsquo;m as excited as ever. But then an idea pops up in my mind: homelabbing.
 My first &amp;ldquo;homelab&amp;rdquo; ever I&amp;rsquo;ve got a server at home for quite a long time.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re from Brazil, you may have seen all those news about a massive flood happened to the brazilian state of Bahia. It happens that I&amp;rsquo;m actually from there and a few people from my family got homeless due to the flood. It&amp;rsquo;s 3 AM here at the time of writing and I feel lonely and kind of useless on dealing with the entire situation&amp;hellip; So, I decided to host this blog up and write this very post about Linux rootkits.</description>
