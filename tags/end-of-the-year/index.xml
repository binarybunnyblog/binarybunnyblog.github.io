      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re from Brazil, you may have seen all those news about a massive flood happened to the brazilian state of Bahia. It happens that I&amp;rsquo;m actually from there and a few people from my family got homeless due to the flood. It&amp;rsquo;s 3 AM here at the time of writing and I feel lonely and kind of useless on dealing with the entire situation&amp;hellip; So, I decided to host this blog up and write this very post about Linux rootkits.</description>
