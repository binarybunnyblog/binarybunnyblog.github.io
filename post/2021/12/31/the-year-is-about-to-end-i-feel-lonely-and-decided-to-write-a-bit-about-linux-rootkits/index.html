    <p>If you&rsquo;re from Brazil, you may have seen <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/12/28/americas/brazil-bahia-flooding-intl/index.html">all those news about a massive flood happened to the brazilian state of Bahia</a>. It happens that I&rsquo;m actually from there and a few people from my family got homeless due to the flood. It&rsquo;s 3 AM here at the time of writing and I feel lonely and kind of useless on dealing with the entire situation&hellip; So, I decided to host this blog up and write this very post about Linux rootkits.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-boring-what-is-a-rootkit-section">A boring &ldquo;what is a rootkit?&rdquo; section</h2>
<p>Wikipedia defines a rootkit as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A rootkit is a collection of computer software, typically malicious, designed to enable access to a computer or an area of its software that is not otherwise allowed (for example, to an unauthorized user) and often masks its existence or the existence of other software.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As one would expect, most rootkits runs on ring 0 (same level of privileges of a kernel). User-mode rootkits are often made however, using fun tricks such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/426230/what-is-the-ld-preload-trick"><code>LD_PRELOAD</code></a>. But here we&rsquo;re going straight forward to the kernel-mode ones.</p>
<h2 id="lkm-rootkits-and-the-usual-attack-chain">LKM rootkits and the usual attack-chain</h2>
<p>Ring 0 rootkits are written as <em>Linux Kernel Modules</em> (LKM for short), which allows an attacker to easily hook syscalls for example, but requires that same attacker to have root privileges in the victim&rsquo;s system for load it.</p>
<p>With that in mind, attackers usually perform social engineering techniques or even privilege-scalation exploits to gain victim&rsquo;s root password.</p>
<hr>
<p>Quick note of a random idea I just got.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s attack-chain could have both user-mode and kernel-mode rootkits. The former could be used to hook <code>sudo</code> (example) for stealing root password and using it to load the latter.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-a-ring-0-rootkit-capable-of">What is a ring 0 rootkit capable of?</h2>
<p>In short, <em>almost everything</em>. In fact, it&rsquo;s hard to think of something kernel-mode rootkits aren&rsquo;t capable of as they run as part of the kernel.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-you-writing-all-of-this">Why are you writing all of this????</h2>
<p><em>I know, I know</em>. Everything I wrote until far didn&rsquo;t go in-depth on the topic.</p>
<p>To be honest, this post has been written just for being <em>an indirect introduction to me and my blog</em>. An attentive reader may have got some basic knowledge of my own personality <em>just from this very written sentences</em>.</p>
<p>I actually <em>planned</em> talking in-depth about LKM rootkits and stuff but I&rsquo;m honestly feeling bad and just noted that, if I&rsquo;m not going depth in the subject, then everything I wrote is basically useless as the same message has been said a hundred times before with different sentences each: It&rsquo;s just like fooling you around and not contributing at all with knowledge or even teaching you something you didn&rsquo;t know, and <em>I don&rsquo;t like doing that</em>.</p>
<h2 id="a-frustrating-conclusion">A frustrating conclusion</h2>
<p>Sorry for basically wasting your time writing about rootkits, just to have some weird crisis and venting. I don&rsquo;t know yet if this blog is about technology or my feelings (maybe both?).</p>
<p>For those who made it up until this far, I plan writing more posts about linux rootkits in the future but going actually in-depth and not venting in the middle of it.</p>
<p>Thank y&rsquo;all so much. ðŸ’œ</p>
